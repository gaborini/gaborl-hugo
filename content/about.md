I am Gabor, a software-and-hardware builder with a strong soft spot for nerdy systems that are both useful and a little strange.

My first machine was a **Commodore 64**, and that early "READY." prompt still defines how I think:
keep things understandable, make experiments runnable, and learn by building.

I started with simple BASIC-style curiosity, and over time that grew into practical engineering across:

- Arduino and ESP32 for embedded control and sensing
- Raspberry Pi for edge orchestration and local reliability
- Rust for robust ingest pipelines, automation logic, and tooling
- Linux-first workflows with observability and disciplined debugging

This blog is my lab notebook in public.
I document real projects, failed assumptions, field fixes, and the architecture choices behind each system.
The goal is not to publish polished marketing stories, but to share reproducible engineering thinking.

If you enjoy topics like edge computing, embedded reliability, weird prototypes, low-level debugging, and long-form technical writeups, you are in the right place.

I still treat every new project like that first C64 session:
type something, run it, break it, understand it, improve it, repeat.
