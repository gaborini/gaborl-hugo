These are the kinds of projects I build and document on this site:

- Sensor and automation builds with Arduino and ESP-class boards.
- Raspberry Pi services for home labs and edge devices.
- Rust-based tools for embedded workflows and backend utilities.

Every project write-up focuses on wiring, software design, and real-world tradeoffs.
